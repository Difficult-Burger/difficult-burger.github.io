Research Experiences 
======
### [Intelligent Networking and Multimedia Lab](https://mypage.cuhk.edu.cn/academics/wangfangxin/people.html) (INML, Supervisor: Prof. Fangxin Wang)
*Research Assistant, Edge Intelligence Group*  
*Dec 2023 - Aug 2024, Shenzhen, China*

Main Jobs:
1. **Designed prompts** for the existing LLM (GPT-3.5-turbo) using **zero-shot learning and in-context learning** techniques, enabling it to autonomously select the appropriate **multimodal tools** via langchain.
2. Improved prompts designs to enhance the **LLM’s** (DeepSeek) **understanding and summarization** of usage scenarios and parameter types for 10 different tools, serving as the foundation of its **Chain-of-Thought reasoning**.
3. Designed experiments to study the effectiveness of **federated LLM learning in tool invocation**, simulating **data non-sharing** by assigning different **prompt parameters** to each client.


### [Human-Crypto Society Laboratory](https://hcslab.cuhk.edu.cn/) (HCSLab, Supervisor: Prof. Wei Cai)
*Research Assistant, Web3 Data Analysis Group*  
*Feb 2023 - Jul 2023, Shenzhen, China*

Main jobs:
1. Implemented anti-crawling using **Python** with **Selenium & BeautifulSoup**, located HTML tags, **crawled data** on web pages, performed basic **data cleaning** and then exported data to **assist other group members** in their research;
2. Performed **data visualization** into diagram using Pyecharts (Echarts for Python);
3. Followed the news from both academia and industry, summarized them and provided initial insights;
4. Read related papers and reported regularly.


Internship Experiences
======
### Baidu Online Network Technology (Beijing) Co., Ltd.
*Speech Algorithm Intern, Synthesis and Integration Group, Speech Technology Department*  
*Jun 2024 - Aug 2024, Beijing, China*

Main jobs:
1. Performed **slot normalization** to convert spoken numerical expressions in English into real numbers, percentages and phone numbers, improving the language model's comprehension and training accuracy.
2. **Parsed parameter conditions** obtained through intent recognition and **converted them into specific function calls** to support voice interactions in automotive digital cockpits.
3. **Used Llama3-8B to generate chat data**, including 20,000 sets of semantically neutral data, 20,000 sets of single-turn dialogues, and 5,000 sets of multi-turn dialogues, for training semantic LLMs.
4. **Refined JSON data** from LLM responses by recursively validating and correcting the JSON format using **Python’s JSON package and the Llama3-8B interface**, cleaning 100 responses.
5. Cleaned a dataset containing hundreds of thousands of “seed query-intent + similar query-intent” pairs. Through string parsing, similarity filtering, and duplicate removal, generated a dataset of **millions of “query-intent” pairs** for training **intent recognition** models.
6. Independently developed the human feedback features of a **Multi-Turn Task-Oriented Dialogue System** to support data labeling. Reconstructed the Natural Language Understanding (**NLU**) module, to enhance the model's ability to recognize user **intents** and **slots**, execute tasks, or request additional information when needed. Implemented front-end interactions with Streamlit to improve user engagement and resolved conflicts between back-end and front-end operations by adjusting algorithmic processes.
