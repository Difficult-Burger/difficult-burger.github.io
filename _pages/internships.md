## [Binance](https://www.binance.com/)
*Data Scientist (AI/LLM) Intern, LLM Team, AI-Data Services Department*  
*Sept 2025 - Present, Decentralized*

## [ByteDance](https://www.bytedance.com/)
*Large Language Model Algorithm Intern, MarsCode Team, Stone, Product Development & Engineering Architecture*  
*May 2025 - Aug 2025, Shenzhen, China*

## [Vitaly Medical Inc.](https://vitalymedicals.com)
*Machine Learning Intern*  
*Oct 2024 - Feb 2025, Berkeley, USA*

Utilized the open-source wrist-worn accelerometer dataset WEDA-FALL to design and implement a **fall detection system**:
1. Applied data preprocessing techniques including **filtering**, **segmentation**, and **feature extraction**.
2. Designed and trained a **machine learning model** for fall detection, obtaining an accuracy of **98.6%**.
3. Enhanced the system by implementing a post-fall inactivity recognition feature.

## [Baidu Inc.](https://home.baidu.com)
*Speech Algorithm Intern, Synthesis and Integration Group, Speech Technology Department*  
*Jun 2024 - Aug 2024, Beijing, China*

Main jobs:
1. Performed **slot normalization** to convert spoken numerical expressions in English into real numbers, percentages and phone numbers, improving the language model's comprehension and training accuracy.
2. **Parsed parameter conditions** obtained through intent recognition and **converted them into specific function calls** to support voice interactions in automotive digital cockpits.
3. **Used Llama3-8B to generate chat data**, including 20,000 sets of semantically neutral data, 20,000 sets of single-turn dialogues, and 5,000 sets of multi-turn dialogues, for training semantic LLMs.
4. **Refined JSON data** from LLM responses by recursively validating and correcting the JSON format using **Python’s JSON package and the Llama3-8B interface**, cleaning 100 responses.
5. Cleaned a dataset containing hundreds of thousands of “seed query-intent + similar query-intent” pairs. Through string parsing, similarity filtering, and duplicate removal, generated a dataset of **millions of “query-intent” pairs** for training **intent recognition** models.
6. Independently developed the human feedback features of a **Multi-Turn Task-Oriented Dialogue System** to support data labeling. Reconstructed the Natural Language Understanding (**NLU**) module, to enhance the model's ability to recognize user **intents** and **slots**, execute tasks, or request additional information when needed. Implemented front-end interactions with Streamlit to improve user engagement and resolved conflicts between back-end and front-end operations by adjusting algorithmic processes.
